Autonomous bounty + trading ops agent. Tasker works, Lila manages, Analyst
researches. The operator watches from a mobile-first PWA.

---

## What it is

A three-role autonomous team inside one Next.js app:

- **Operator** — you. Direct-line chat with Lila, approves/submits reports,
  marks payouts when money actually lands.
- **Lila (manager)** — replies to the operator, reviews every Tasker draft
  before it surfaces, runs the trade cycle against Alpaca, posts proactive
  check-ins, publishes hourly updates to Bluesky when something notable
  happened.
- **Tasker (executor)** — grinds security bounties one codebase at a time.
  A target-pinned phase machine (`map → surfaces → invariants → hypothesize
  → investigate`) accumulates research notes across cycles. Non-security
  bounties go through a simpler one-shot path.
- **Analyst (Vega)** — market intelligence. Reads news, scans watchlists, files
  picks with tight stops. Mirrors picks to Telegram when configured.
- **Handicapper (Ceelo)** — autonomous NFL sports betting model. Maintains an internal 
  Elo ratings graph from nflverse historical data, fetches live spreads from 
  The Odds API, and flags +EV edges. Mirrors picks to Telegram.

All of it runs on a single server-side ticker so Lila keeps working whether
you have the PWA open or not.

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router, PWA, mobile-only viewport)
- **Postgres** (schema lazy-created on first tick; zero-downtime ALTERs)
- **DeepSeek** for all LLM calls (budget-gated, per-module cost tracking)
- **Alpaca** for trading (paper by default, live via `ALPACA_PAPER=false`)
- **Bluesky** via AT Proto for hourly public broadcasts
- **Telegram** Bot API for Analyst picks & Ceelo alerts
- **The Odds API** for live NFL spreads and totals
- **nflverse** data for historical Elo ratings
- **TradingView lightweight-charts** for the Trades and Picks edge graphs
- **Railway** for hosting

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in at minimum: AUTH_PASSWORD, DATABASE_URL, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/login` and sign in with your `AUTH_PASSWORD`.

## Deploy to Railway

1. New service → this repo → Dockerfile builder.
2. Add a Postgres plugin. `DATABASE_URL` auto-populates.
3. Paste the env vars you want from `.env.example`. Only the three
   required ones (`AUTH_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`)
   must be set; everything else lights up features progressively.
4. Railway's healthcheck hits `/api/health` and arms the autonomy ticker.

```

Plus a parallel **Analyst** state machine (T0/T1/T2/T3/F0/M0/M1) that
reads news and market bars, files picks into `analyst_picks`, and
mirrors them to Telegram. **TradingEngine** runs every tick, monitors
open positions, closes on target/stop, and executes pending picks during
market hours.

A **Handicapper (Ceelo)** loop (C0/C1/C2/C3/C4/C5) maintains an internal Elo
graph using nflverse data, diffs model spreads against live Odds API book
lines, and emits mathematical picks into `ceelo_picks`.

## Loops

### Tasker bounty cycle (30s per step, configurable)

```
BT0  parse recent chat for operator/Lila-assigned tasks
BH0  work the pinned target — one ResearchEngine cycle OR
     a one-shot code bounty if no security target is hot
BZ0  post status to chat
```

### ResearchEngine phase machine (3-min gate between cycles)

Each phase reads ALL prior notes for the target and extends them. The
accumulated memory is the whole point — a one-shot LLM pass doesn't beat
Slither; sustained attention on one codebase is where real findings come
from.

```
map → surfaces → invariants → hypothesize → investigate → (found | exhausted)
```

A confirmed finding saves a report to `security_reports` with status
`pending_review` — **Lila reviews every draft before the operator sees
it**.

### Ceelo handicapper (30-min gated)

Autonomous loop for mathematical sports betting.

```
C0  refresh NFL schedule & injuries
C1  grade finals to update the Elo ratings graph
C2  pull live book lines from The Odds API
C3  compute model win-prob and spreads
C4  diff model vs market; emit picks when |edge| ≥ 1.0 pt
C5  reconcile kicked-off games
```

### Lila management (priority-ordered, once per tick)

1. Reply to any unanswered operator message (20-min lookback).
2. Review one pending `security_reports` row — approve or reject with a
   one-line note.
3. Trade cycle (15-min gated): stance + trades with tight stops +
   HOLD/CLOSE on open positions, executed against Alpaca directly.
4. Proactive check-in (5-min gated): flags paid bounties, error spikes,
   approved reports waiting for the operator.

### Broadcast (60-min gated, silent hours skip)

Only posts when something notable happened (paid bounty, closed trade
≥ $1, newly approved report). One LLM call per post. Bluesky only.

## Financial integrity

Earnings only move when real money lands:

- `status='pending_review'` → Tasker drafted, Lila hasn't seen it
- `status='approved'` → Lila cleared it; operator submits manually
- `status='submitted'` → you sent it in; **still not earnings**
- `status='paid'` → operator entered actual payout amount → `total_earned`
  moves by that delta

Plus closed-trade P&L on Alpaca positions. Everything else is marked as
"pending" or "max" in the UI.

## Tabs

- **Chat** — direct line to Lila with Tasker/Analyst status feed. Every
  message has a copy button.
- **Log** — raw system log.
- **Dash** — confirmed earnings, costs with daily budget bar, broadcast
  status, current research target (phase + cycles + hypothesis counts),
  Alpaca portfolio, Superteam setup.
- **Trades** — Alpaca equity curve with `lightweight-charts`, realized
  P&L curve, open/closed positions with stop/target progress bars.
- **Board** — live bounty listings across platforms.
- **Reports** — pipeline: Ready to submit → Submitted awaiting payout →
  Paid → Lila reviewing → Archive.
- **Picks** — Ceelo's NFL handicapper dashboard. Displays a visual `lightweight-charts`
  Edge Graph, tracks open/active/settled picks, and provides a direct
  chat interface with Ceelo.

## Env vars

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full commented reference.

**Required:** `AUTH_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`

**Feature-gated (set to enable):**
- Trading → `ALPACA_API_KEY` + `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` + `ALPACA_PAPER`
- Bounty sources → `SUPERTEAM_API_KEY`, `NEYNAR_API_KEY`, `CLAWTASKS_API_KEY`, `WALLET_ADDRESS`
- Bluesky broadcasts → `BSKY_HANDLE` + `BSKY_APP_PASSWORD`
- Telegram picks feed → `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
- Ceelo Edge Gate → `ODDS_API_KEY`

**Tuning knobs** (all optional, defaults sensible):
`TASKER_STEP_SEC`, `RESEARCH_CYCLE_SEC`, `MANAGEMENT_CHECK_SEC`,
`MANAGEMENT_TRADE_SEC`, `ANALYST_STEP_MIN`, `BROADCAST_INTERVAL_MIN`,
`AUTONOMY_TICK_MS`, `DAILY_LLM_BUDGET_USD`, `ENABLE_AUTONOMY_TICKER`,
`ENABLE_BROADCAST`.

## Cost discipline

Every background LLM call flows through `lib/llm.ts` with a per-module
tag. Daily budget enforced (default $5/day background; operator chat
stream is exempt so Lila always replies). Cost card on Dash shows the
daily burn, MTD spend, MTD paid, net, and the top modules by burn.

Silent hours on the Broadcast loop cost zero tokens. Research cycles are
gated 3 minutes apart on the same target so cheap code bounties can fill
the gaps.

## Disclosure

This is an autonomous operations stack. Real money moves only when real
keys are provided. Nothing in this repo constitutes financial advice or
a guarantee of earnings. Deploy at your own risk; review the trading
parameters in `lib/trading-engine.ts` before pointing `ALPACA_PAPER=false`
at anything.
